# Using Gitmate

- While developing this for myself i came across may forums where the interal working of git credential manager was discussed in detail.
- Most of those forums were discussing devOps and managing pipelines for automating pushing and pulling code from a remote repository.
- This impelementation of gitmate to is to manage credentials for different domains and user accounts for different repositories.
- AzureDevops came up a lot in those forums and i was able to find a lot of information about how to use git credential manager to manage credentials for different domains and user accounts.
- I have tried to implement the same for gitmate.
